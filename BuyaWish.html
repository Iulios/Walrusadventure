	<p>The walrus hands the wizard $5 and he puts it in his pocket. He sings "Smooth Criminal" by Michael Jackson while the translator beat boxes, then they both dissapear leaving a cloud of smoke. When the smoke dissipates, a small hole the size of a quarter is in the ground where the wizard was standing. The walrus makes his way over to the hole and peers inside. He sees the vast Arcic tundra of his youth, then looks up at the northern lights. He walks past a herd of walruses on the shore, and one of them turns and says "Guys look, Jeff is back!". He jumps into the nice, cold, water and sees an endless bed of clams. </p>
