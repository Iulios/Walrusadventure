	<p>The Walrus exits the airport with no money. There's a heavy snowstorm and frigid weather which he enjoys. <br> He rolls around in the snow until he gets bored<br> Then he wanders around the empty streets of Russia.<br> After 5 hours of wandering around, he winds up the Palace Square. He is overcome with loneliness.The vast, thick snow, makes him feel homesick. He longs for a time when the ice wasn't melting.<br> Then he realizes that he's hungry, and he has no money to buy food.  <br></p>
